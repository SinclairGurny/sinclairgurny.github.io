  I'm Sinclair, I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer and Infrastructure Engineer at Stonewall Defense.
  
  I finished a 5 year coterminal program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in May 2020. Which consisted of a B.S. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science in May 2019 which focused on artificial intelligence, programming languages, and distributed systems. I completed my M.S. in Computer Science in May 2020.
  
  My thesis "Learning Models from Avionics Data Streams" focuses on using declarative machine learning to create a data-driven system which can estimate aircraft weight in real-time during take-off. By being the only system which uses no external sensors and does real time estimation before leaving the runway it would be capable of preventing such accidents. I also got a paper accepted to into the Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC) 2020, titled "Aircraft Weight Estimation During Take-off Using Declarative Machine Learning". My publications can be found [here](https://wcl.cs.rpi.edu/bib/Author/GURNY-S.html)

  Learning and improving is my true passion.
  I use GNU Emacs because I love the customizability and keyboard interface of emacs.
  I currently use the Soul keyboard layout (very similar to Colemak) because it was a fun challenge to fight with my typing muscle memory and also improve the ergonomics of typing.
  I am also an avid Shogi player (Japanese chess) and captain a shogi team which won our division in 2021.
