    I learned a lot from my time at RPI. I have taken courses in everything from Circuits to Neuroscience. My focus was distributed systems, distributed programming languages, and high-performance computing within my computer science courses. Within cognitive science my focus was artificial intelligence and robotics, with my biggest interest being cognitive architectures.

    My graduate research in the Worldwide Computing Lab was focused on distributed data-driven systems. My thesis "Learning Models from Avionics Data Streams" is the only data-driven program which is designed to prevent aviation accidents due to overweight or underweight take-offs. For example Tuninter 1153 (12.5% under weight, lack of fuel), Cessna 172R N420P (6% over max weight), and Aerosucre Flight 157 (1.3% over max weight, overran runway). In more technical detail, it is focused on the applications of declarative machine-learning to estimate fixed-wing aircraft weight during take-off.
